# Unity Fps Setter
 
A simple Editor window to quickly change the game framerate.

## Getting Started

• Window > General > FPS Setter<br>
• Set the Target Fps<br>
• The framerate will get influenced by the Fps Setter window as long as it exists in the Editor (as a tab even if not in front, docked window or floating window)
